I'm completing multiple tutorials on Jekyll and static sites to improve my teaching and knowledge of static site generation.

## About About Pages

The About page is a common convention found on websites.
It is your opportunity to let us know all the details "about" your project:

- focus and topic area
- people involved
- code and projects used
